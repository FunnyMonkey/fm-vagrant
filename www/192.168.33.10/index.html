<h1>Site setup</h1>
You are currently accessing this site via direct <a href="http://192.168.33.10">192.168.33.10</a>.

<h2>Dynamic virtual host aliases</h2>
You can also host via dynamic sub-domains just create a folder with the appropriate name. For example if you add a folder 'fm-vagrant.local' to the 'www' directory in this repo and you put an entry in your 'etc/hosts' file mapping 192.168.33.10 to fm-vagrant.local then you will serve the files located in fm-vagrant.local directory when you access <a href="http://fm-vagrant.local">fm-vagrant.local</a>.
